# Bionic Reading

This Python notebook implements a bionic reading technique that enhances reading speed and comprehension using machine learning. The notebook utilizes Markdown syntax to format the output text, emphasizing the initial characters of words to facilitate rapid reading.

## Features

- **Bionic Reading**: Present text in a bionic reading format, where the initial characters of words are highlighted to aid in rapid reading.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilize machine learning techniques to preprocess and format text for bionic reading.
- **Customizable**: Easily train the model using the dataset creation tool bundled with the repo. Adjustable parameters.
- **Markdown Output**: Output the formatted text using Markdown syntax for seamless integration with various platforms and applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/bionic-reading-python-notebook.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Bionic-reading.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook to generate and view the bionic reading output.

## Usage

- **Input Text**: Provide the text you want to convert to bionic reading format as input.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Experiment with different parameters such as highlighting intensity and word presentation speed to find the optimal settings for your reading experience.
- **Generate Output**: Run the notebook to generate the bionic reading output in Markdown format.

## Example

```markdown
**"Do** **No**t **Ente**r." **The** **si**gn **ma**de **i**t **clea**r **tha**t **the**y **didn**t **wa**nt **anyo**ne **arou**nd. 
```
